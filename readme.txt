This plugin runs once a week to create a post with the instagram photos you took since it ran the last time.

== Description ==
This plugin runs once a week to create a post with the instagram photos you took since it ran the last time.

It is possible to have the plugin create a WordPress-native gallery or include the photos as a list of images. The pictures are being imported into your media library.

This also works for blogs with multiple authors.

== Installation ==
* Install the plugin as usual and activate it.
* If you are an admin user, you will find a new entry in the "Settings" menu, where you need to put your Instagram API key and secret. Further information is provided on that menu page.
* Once this is done, every author (including yourself, obviously), will have a new entry in the "Tools" menu - here you connect your blog to Instagram and change some display settings.
